#Approaching My Task: 
For this specific program I had to learn about the Bitwise operator and how it works specefically and the logic behind it. After I had done my research and work regarding this program . I sat down to write the main algorithm that I would use to take the inputs from the end user and then use those inputs to check the bitwise and operator.



#Difficulties I Faced:
The program in itself isn't that hard or time consuming if you know what are you doing but for me I didn't know about the bitwise and operator specifically and I was very hesitant to write this program at first but with time and by researching on the Internet I figured it out.
And secondly the algorithm for this program is rather tricky at instances to understand but I cracked it down eventually .
