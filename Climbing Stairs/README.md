#Approaching My Task:
So , I took a subtle approach on this specific program at first I devised the math alogrithm I was going to use for this and then I simply just programmed it.
The main approach I took was to understand how this was going to calculate the number of dinstinctive steps it was going to take therefore I used two different functions to execute this whole program one being climbStairs for the main part of the calculations and the other one being main to execute and
call the climbStairs function.
And ofcourse I used four different variables and each of their purpose and uses have been well documented in the program file's comments itself.



#Difficulties While Writing the program:
Executing the Main function in this program specefically wasn't that hard .
The main problem I faced was to write and design the logic and working of the climbStairs function and how it was going to calculate and return the value for printing the distintive ways of the climbed steps.
