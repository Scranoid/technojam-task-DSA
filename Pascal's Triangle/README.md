#Approaching my task:
Umm so basically Pascal's Triangle works on the principle of binomial coefficients , I've studied a lot of those in my JEE times but now was the time to implement it 
so the main approach was clear to me from the beggining that I had to create a variable to take the input from the user of about how many ROWS did he/she want.
The next thing I did was to create the main logic and loops for the program to function correctly , I took a total of 5 variables out of which I used 2 for FOR loops and 
1  for taking the number of rows the user wants and 1 for spacing and another one for storing the values of the numbers to be printed on the triangles...


#Challenges I faced:
This program didn't gave me the trouble on the calculation part.
But it was quite challenging for me to create the appropriate spacing and incorporating the for loops at first but I eventually figured it out using mt tried and tested
method which is trial and error :) .
