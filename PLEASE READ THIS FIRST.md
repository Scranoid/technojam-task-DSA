Respected Sir/Ma'am and whosoever is reading this , 
I am Abhinav Jha a student of Computer Science studying in your university and have been studying and loving computers for his entire life since I gained abitlity  to study and be concious. I am a very big CUDA and CPU architectural design fan as well so I have learnt many other things previously which have helped me in going to that path as well.

I've been following good programming practices since I was a little kid , but the main reason being when I started my journey with the book on C from Greg Perry and Dean Miller(fabulous book you all should read it). Therefore don't confuse my written codes with some LLM generated slop because I use proper whitespaces and indentation in my code as I have collaborated with many other people on github and gitlab as well previously.



# DISCLAIMER
Respected Sir/Ma'am ,
Although I've done a decent amount of work previously but I was still not able to do the last two questions of the DSA question pack due to time restrictions and difficulty levels as well(they were really really good)...
I could've copied the code from an LLM or StackOverFlow'ed it but I am very true to whatever I do and that was the reason I sumbitted the only work which I did on my past knowledge and experience , but still I'm very happy  for the fact that there is a lot more room to grow and TechnoJam will enable me with the appropriate toolset and the best mindset I can have to achieve whatever I've planned for the upcoming times....
