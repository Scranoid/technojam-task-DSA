#Approaching My Task :
So how do I put it , Initially I thought that this was going to be easy but as I approached and 
looked on to the task at hand , I found it rather interesting to go and look onto the problem.
At first I defined a value  MAXINP as 100 and took the value as the character array size , then I created
a FOR loop in which I gave a pair of IF and ELSE statements. Alongside in the IF conditional I appended
the count integer variable I assigned for taking the total number of times the Letter had been repeated and in 
the ELSE one I printed the number of times the variable was repeated .


#Difficulties I Specifically Faced:
I you see the program carefully I specefically placed a printf statement in the FOR loop's end because 
if I removed it the last repeating letter's number would'nt show and it's reason is very interesting . I'll explain it at the auditions.
:)
